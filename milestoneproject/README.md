# Blog

Blog app is where user can create account and post their posts. I start with this simple website idea to easily understand how to work with Django but the final milestoneproject could be different one.

## Data Model

- title

## Site Functional Areas

### User Management

- Register New Users
- Log In / Log Out
- Update Existing Users

### View Posts

- List all Posts of different User

### Revise Post
